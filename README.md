# calorie-counter
This is code for a web app that allows calorie counting and logging.

The calorielog database is for calculating how many calories are in a particular serving size of a particular food,
while the diary database - empty by default - is for logging the user's calories consumed, weight, and whether or not
the user exercised or overate on a particular day (boolean 0 for no and 1 for yes).

Instructions for Use:
Download the files, and CD to the directory through Terminal.
Run main.py using Python from the Terminal, and go to the local URL.
